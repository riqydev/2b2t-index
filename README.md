# 2b2t-index
a player lookup website that lets you view stats of people that have played on the minecraft anarchy server 2b2t
- Live Site URL: [here](https://riqydev.github.io/2b2t-index/)

### why?

- I needed to derust my very basic html / css / js knowledge as it has been a long time since I have done any web dev. This seemed like an easy thing to start with. Has some basic responsiveness, api calls & basic DOM manipulation. Just something to kick start my brain.
